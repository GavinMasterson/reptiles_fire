During 2005/6, I surveyed reptiles in Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve and investigated their response to localised site disturbance.
This analysis serves as the reproducible foundation of the analysis for the published paper.
All analysis was conducted by [Gavin Masterson](https://gavinmasterson.netlify.app/).
