During 2005/6, I surveyed reptiles in Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve and investigated their response to localised site disturbance.
This analysis serves as the reproducible analysis used for the published paper.
All code for the analyses shown here was written by [Gavin Masterson](https://gavinmasterson.netlify.app/).
